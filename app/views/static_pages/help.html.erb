  <h3>What is Vax?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      First and foremost, Vax! is a game about epidemic prevention. It's also
      an interactive learning environment designed to visualize a process that
      strains our imagination: A contagion spreading across a network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players are tasked to vaccinate a randomly generated network that resembles
      human social networks. Eventually, an infectious outbreak begins to spread
      and the player is tasked to quell the epidemic with quarantine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vax! is a puzzle-game infused with chance that was inspired by fusion of
      real-world challenges, theoretical models, and addictively rewarding games.

  <h3>Future of Vax...</h3>

    <p>
     We plan to develop modules, designed as mini-games, to delve into complex
     topics related to the spread of infectious diseases. The goal is advance
     the public's understanding without the technical jargon and equations.
